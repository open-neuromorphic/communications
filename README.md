# Open Neuromorphic Community Hub & Operations

Welcome! This repository is the central hub for the Open Neuromorphic (ONM) community's governance, strategic initiatives, and operational planning. It serves as both a public portal for our documentation and an internal workspace for leadership and contributors.

Our mission is to advance neuromorphic computing through open-source projects, inclusive participation, and shared knowledge. Whether you're here to learn about our structure or to contribute to an initiative, this is the place to start.
