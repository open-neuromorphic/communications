Aligned with our [2025 Strategic Initiatives](https://open-neuromorphic.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/Strategy/pages/131285/ONM+Strategic+Initiatives+2025), every issue should be tagged with at least one of the following initiative labels:

| Label                     | Description |
|---------------------------|-------------|
| `community-engagement`    | Organizing workshops, hacking hours, or public-facing initiatives to strengthen community bonds |
| `open-source-dev`         | Contributions to shared codebases, documentation, or tooling supporting the ONM open-source ecosystem |
| `educational-outreach`    | Tutorials, talks, or learning materials for students and practitioners entering neuromorphic computing |
| `infrastructure`          | Work that improves internal systems, coordination tools, or long-term sustainability of our platforms |
| `strategic-partnerships`  | Activities related to funding, collaborations, or partnerships that advance ONM’s mission |

These initiative labels help align tasks with ONM's long-term goals.
