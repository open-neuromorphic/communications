## 🎯 Objective

Investigate and recommend sustainable, transparent funding mechanisms to support ONM’s growth, initiatives, and infrastructure.

---

## 🧠 Problem Statement

ONM currently operates on a volunteer basis, but long-term sustainability requires some funding.  
_Hypothesis:_ We believe that identifying and implementing suitable funding models (e.g., fiscal sponsorship, donations, sponsorships) will provide stability and enable new initiatives, and we’ll know we’ve succeeded if ONM can reliably cover basic costs and support community-driven projects.

## 🧾 Key Outcomes

- Research and summary of fiscal sponsorship and donation options
- Drafted operational budget for ONM’s core needs
- Sponsorship prospectus document for potential partners
