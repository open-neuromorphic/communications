## 🎯 Objective

Enhance ONM’s internal infrastructure to support leadership and contributor efficiency by improving workflows and tool integration.

---

## 🧠 Problem Statement

As ONM grows, fragmented tools and inconsistent workflows create inefficiencies for leadership and contributors.  
We believe that by auditing and upgrading our internal tools, we can reduce friction, improve collaboration, and enable scalable growth.  
We’ll know we’ve succeeded if contributors report faster coordination, and leadership reduces time spent on redundant tasks.

## 🧾 Key Outcomes

- Inventory of existing tools and workflows  
- Documented list of pain points and needs
