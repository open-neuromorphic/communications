### **The Social Media Playbook: Your Task List**

This is your core to-do list, broken down by type and frequency.

#### **A. The Event Promotion Workflow (Pre, During, and Post-Event)**

This is our most important sequence. Consistency here is key to driving attendance and impact.

**1. Pre-Event (For scheduled Workshops, Student Talks, etc.)**
*   **[1 Week Before] Announcement Post:**
    *   **Action:** Create a post announcing the event.
    *   **Content:** Include the title, speaker(s), date, time (with multiple time zones, e.g., CEST/EST), and a short, exciting description of what people will learn.
    *   **Crucial Link:** Always link to the event page on the **ONM website** (e.g., `open-neuromorphic.org/workshops/event-name/`). This page has all the details and the direct link to the stream.
    *   **Visuals:** Use the auto-generated "portrait" social media cards from the website's share panel. They look great on LinkedIn and Twitter/X.
    *   **Tags:** Tag the speaker(s) and their institutions. Use hashtags like `#neuromorphic`, `#SNN`, `#opensource`, `#AI`.

*   **[24 Hours Before] Reminder Post:**
    *   **Action:** Post a reminder for the event tomorrow.
    *   **Content:** Use a slightly different text, e.g., "Don't miss our workshop tomorrow with @Speaker!" Reiterate the key takeaway.
    *   **Visuals & Link:** Use the same visual and link to the website page.

*   **[1 Hour Before] "Going Live Soon" Post:**
    *   **Action:** Final reminder post.
    *   **Content:** "We're going live in one hour! Join the conversation here:"
    *   **Link:** Link directly to the YouTube stream or the website page.

**2. Post-Event**
*   **[Within 24 Hours] "Recording is Live" Post:**
    *   **Action:** Share the link to the recorded video on YouTube.
    *   **Content:** Thank the speaker and everyone who attended. Include a key quote or a fascinating insight from the talk.
    *   **Tags:** Tag the speaker(s) again.

*   **[Ongoing] Create Short-Form Content (Video Shorts/Clips):**
    *   **Action:** Use StreamYard's built-in tool to create 30-60 second vertical video clips of the most interesting moments from a talk.
    *   **Content:** Focus on a single, powerful idea, a "wow" moment, or a great explanation. Add captions. This is a fantastic way to repurpose content and reach a new audience.
    *   **Idea Source:** Refer to the "First Impressions" Video Shorts concept from **Issue #84** for inspiration on making these engaging and "hypey."

#### **B. Weekly Recurring Tasks**

*   **[15 Minutes Before] Monday Morning: Promote the Town Hall:**
    *   **Action:** Post a reminder for the weekly Community Town Hall.
    *   **Content:** "It's Monday! That means it's time for the ONM Town Hall. Join us at 14:00 CEST / 8:00 ET to catch up on the latest initiatives and share your ideas."
    *   **Link:** Include the YouTube event link (youtube and linkedin events created within StreamYard).

*   **End of Week: Community Contributor Shout-Out:**
    *   **Action:** Coordinate with the leadership team to get a summary of interesting Discord discussions (based on **Issue #28**).
    *   **Content:** Create a post giving a shout-out to the top 2-3 contributors of the week and briefly mention the topics they discussed. This is a powerful way to recognize and encourage engagement.
    *   **Example:** *"Big thanks to @user1 for their deep dive on asynchronous systems and to @user2 for helping newcomers get started with SNNs! Join the conversation on our Discord."*

#### **C. As-Needed Tasks**

*   **New Blog Post Published:** Create a post to announce it, using the title, description, and social media image from the website.
*   **New Initiative Launch (e.g., ONR Call for Submissions):** Work with the initiative lead (e.g., Danny) to craft a series of posts announcing the launch, calling for participants/reviewers, and sharing updates.
*   **New Collaboration Network Member:** Welcome new supporter projects and link to their software/website.
*   **Mission Board Spotlight:** Periodically highlight an interesting "help wanted" issue from the Mission Board to encourage contributions.

### **Tools & Resources**

*   **Visuals:** The website is your best friend! Every event and blog page has a "Share" button that provides pre-made, high-quality images perfect for social media.
*   **Content Source:** The website (`open-neuromorphic.org`), the `communications` GitHub repo, and the Discord server are your primary sources for news and content.

### **Our Tone of Voice**

*   **Authoritative yet Accessible:** We are experts, but we are welcoming to newcomers. Avoid overly dense jargon where possible.
*   **Supportive and Collaborative:** We celebrate the community. Our language should be inclusive, positive, and encouraging.
*   **Forward-Looking and a Little Bit Hype:** We're excited about the future of neuromorphic computing, and it's okay to show it! 

### **Your First 30 Days: A Suggested Plan**

*   **Week 1: Get Your Bearings.**
    *   Get access to all social media accounts.
    *   Review our past posts on LinkedIn and Twitter/X to get a feel for our style.
    *   Introduce yourself in the `#general` Discord channel!
    *   Shadow the promotion of this week's Town Hall.

*   **Week 2: Take the Reins on Recurring Tasks.**
    *   Take the lead on promoting the weekly Town Hall.
    *   Work with us to create your first "Community Contributor Shout-Out" post.

*   **Week 3: Run Your First Full Event Cycle.**
    *   Manage the pre- and post-event promotion for an upcoming Student Talk or Workshop. This will be your first full test run of the event playbook.

*   **Week 4: Start Proposing Ideas!**
    *   Now that you're comfortable, what do you think we could do better? Maybe we can start the **arXiv paper "First Impressions" shorts**? Let's chat about it!

Welcome again! We're here to support you. Don't hesitate to ask questions. Let's build something great together.
