# Initiative Plan: Social Media Engagement & Outreach

**Accountable Fellow:** @SocialMediaCoordinator (Volunteer Role)
**Approver:** @DRosen766, @Jegp, @neural-loop
**Status:** IN PROGRESS

## üéØ Objective

To strategically manage and grow Open Neuromorphic's online presence across key social media platforms (LinkedIn, Twitter/X). This initiative aims to increase community engagement, drive traffic to ONM resources, amplify the work of our contributors, and establish a consistent, authoritative, and welcoming brand voice.

---

## üß† Problem Statement

While ONM has a presence on social media, our efforts can be ad-hoc, lacking a consistent strategy and cadence. This leads to missed opportunities for promoting events, sharing valuable content, and engaging with our growing global audience.

**Hypothesis:** _We believe that implementing a structured social media strategy, managed by a dedicated volunteer, will result in **increased event attendance, higher engagement rates, and significant growth in our follower base and Discord membership.** We‚Äôll know we‚Äôve succeeded if **we see a measurable uptick in these key metrics and receive positive feedback from the community.**_

---

## üßæ Key Outcomes

- A consistent and professional social media presence for ONM.
- Increased visibility and attendance for all ONM events (Workshops, Town Halls, etc.).
- A clear and documented workflow for the social media volunteer.
- Growth in key metrics: followers, engagement rate, and click-throughs to the ONM website.
- Regular amplification of community contributions and successes.
