## üéØ Objective

To transform the Open Neuromorphic website (open-neuromorphic.org) into a dynamic, central hub that embodies the "Open Contributor Journey." This initiative aims to significantly grow ONM's community, impact, and visibility by revitalizing its digital presence, making it easier for users to discover resources, learn, and contribute, thereby establishing ONM as a leading global hub for neuromorphic science, learning, and innovation, reflecting our connectivist and open source ethos.

---

## üß† Problem Statement

The current ONM website, while informative, is largely static and does not optimally guide users from initial discovery to deep engagement and contribution. There's a highly engaged segment of the community (e.g., 756 Discord members tagged for "getting-involved") whose enthusiasm could be better channeled with clearer pathways and more dynamic content. The current structure also doesn't fully leverage SEO potential or strategically funnel users towards active participation.

_‚ÄúWe believe **revitalizing the website into a dynamic hub with clear "inclusion funnels," expanded content sections (like `/learn/`, `/initiatives/`, `/contribute/`, `/community/`), and targeted SEO-driven content** will result in **increased community engagement, a higher rate of new contributor onboarding, and solidify ONM's position as the primary authoritative resource for neuromorphic computing.** We‚Äôll know we‚Äôve succeeded if **we observe significant growth in website traffic to these key sections, achieve top search rankings for "neuromorphic computing," see increased engagement with our YouTube tutorials and hardware/software guides, witness a rise in active contributors on GitHub and Discord, and measure positive feedback on contributor satisfaction and ease of involvement.**‚Äù_

## üßæ Key Outcomes

-   Redesigned Dynamic Landing Page: Serves as an engaging "front door" with highlights and clear "inclusion funnels" (CTAs: "Start Learning," "Contribute," "Join Discussion").
-   Expanded `/neuromorphic-computing/` Hub: Creation of new, well-defined sub-sections: `/initiatives/`, `/learn/` (for Journeys, primers, tutorials), `/contribute/` (guidelines, issues), and `/community/` (Discord, events, charter).
-   Strategic "Inclusion Funnels" Site-Wide: Clear, actionable next steps integrated into content to guide users from discovery to deeper engagement and contribution.
-   Activated Community Involvement: Leveraging community enthusiasm through feedback channels (e.g., Discord discussions, surveys) and potentially through dedicated Working Groups for documentation, content, and website user testing.
-   Improved Content Discoverability: Enhanced SEO for key terms like "neuromorphic computing," specific hardware (TrueNorth, Loihi 2), and SNN frameworks, leading to higher search rankings and increased organic traffic.
-   Clearer Contribution Pathways: Interactive guides and "Contributor Journeys" that lower barriers to entry and illustrate diverse ways to get involved with ONM.
-   Enhanced User Experience: More intuitive navigation and website structure, modeled after a "University Website" concept where appropriate, making resources easier to find.

|------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Must Have        | - Redesign landing page with dynamic content highlights & CTAs. <br/> - Implement the core structure of the expanded `/neuromorphic-computing/` hub (/hardware, /software, /learn, /initiatives, /contribute, /community). <br/> - Initial implementation of "inclusion funnels" on key pages (e.g., popular blog posts, hardware pages). <br/> - Migrate existing high-value content (e.g., TrueNorth blog, hardware/software guides) into the new structure. <br/> - Establish channels for community feedback on website changes (e.g., Discord, surveys) and initiate calls for volunteer participation in key areas (documentation, content, user testing). <br/> - Create basic "How to Contribute to the Website" documentation. <br/> - Initial SEO optimization for top 2-3 target keywords/pages. <br/> - Add the "ONM Initiatives" page. <br/> - Add content for "Hacking Hours". |
| Nice to Have     | - Fully developed, interactive "Contributor Journeys" (video/blog series). <br/> - Comprehensive implementation of the "University Website" model across all relevant sections. <br/> - Lightweight mentorship program integration into contribution pathways. <br/> - Advanced, automated KPI tracking dashboard for website performance and community engagement. <br/> - Full migration and re-categorization of all existing blog/workshop content. <br/> - Overhaul of website visual identity/branding. |
| Not in Scope     | - Development of new, standalone software tools or platforms (focus is on the website as a hub). <br/> - Building a custom CMS; continue leveraging Hugo. <br/> - Large-scale paid advertising campaigns for the website. |
