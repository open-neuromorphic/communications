# ONM Research Initiative ‚Äî Submitter‚Äôs Guide

Welcome to the ONM Research Initiative! This guide outlines how to submit your work for review and inclusion in the ONM Community Peer Review Program.

#### Submissions are accepted on a rolling basis

---

## What Can You Submit?

We welcome open-source neuromorphic projects of all kinds, including but not limited to:

- Research codebases (e.g., SNN models, simulators, benchmarks)
- Datasets and dataset preparation pipelines
- Educational tools, tutorials, and documentation
- Hardware support libraries and FPGA/ASIC interfaces
- Analysis tools, visualization, and measurement utilities

Submissions may take the form of:
- **Git repositories** containing software and documentation  
- **Jupyter notebooks** with code, figures, and narrative explanations  
- **IEEE-formatted papers** (PDF)  
- **Technical whitepapers** or overview documents (PDF or web-hosted)  

Your project must satisfy Open Neuromorphics [Definition of Open](../policies/open-definition.md)

We especially encourage well-documented Jupyter notebooks that walk through core functionality, demonstrate reproducibility, or explain concepts interactively.  Also, please try to submit source files of figures if possible.

## How to Submit

1. **Prepare Your Project**
   Ensure your repository or paper includes:
   - A `README.md` with a project overview and instructions
   - A license file
   - Reproducible setup and usage instructions (e.g., `requirements.txt`, `environment.yml`, `Dockerfile`)
   - (If submitting a notebook) Clear annotations and runnable cells
   - (If submitting a PDF) Title, authors, abstract, and references

2. **Complete the Submission Form**
   Submit your project using the official ONM Research submission form:  
   üîó [Submission Form Link]

   You‚Äôll be asked to provide:
   - Project title and short description
   - Git repository URL (and/or PDF link)
   - Keywords and project category
   - Contributor names and affiliations

3. **Wait for Assignment**
   Your submission will be reviewed by a panel of 3‚Äì5 ONM volunteer reviewers. You‚Äôll receive confirmation and an estimated timeline.

## Review Criteria

Projects are evaluated based on:
- **Openness**: Is the project license-compatible and open to contributions?
- **Impact & Utility**: Does the project address significant challenges in the field of Neuromorphic Computing?
- **Clarity**: Is the project well-implemented, well-documented, and easy to navigate?
- **Documentation**: Are setup and usage instructions complete and usable?
- **Reproducibility**: Can reviewers run or verify the work easily?
- **Technical Quality**: Is the work rigorous, correct, and useful to others?

## Outcomes

We expect to provide decisions by a month after submission.

After review:
- If **approved**, your project will receive:
  - **For software projects:** An ‚ÄúONM Community Approved‚Äù badge (for your README)
  - **For papers:** A listing in the ONM Research Registry
  - Potential to lead talks and workshops through ONM‚Äôs website, Discord, and social media

- If **not yet approved**, you‚Äôll receive actionable feedback and may revise and resubmit.
