## üéØ Objective

To establish a professional, consistent, and streamlined process for planning, executing, and archiving all Open Neuromorphic live events. This initiative aims to enhance the experience for speakers and attendees, maximize community engagement, and create high-quality, lasting educational resources.

## üß† Problem Statement

Currently, ONM events are managed on an ad-hoc basis by various committee members, leading to inconsistent workflows, potential gaps in communication, and a significant time commitment from leadership. This can result in a suboptimal experience for speakers and missed opportunities for promotion and engagement.

**Hypothesis:** _We believe that implementing a structured event coordination strategy, managed by a dedicated volunteer, will result in **a more professional event experience, higher speaker satisfaction, and increased community participation.** We‚Äôll know we‚Äôve succeeded if **we receive consistent positive feedback from speakers, see a reduction in day-of logistical issues, and all events are promoted, executed, and archived according to a documented checklist.**_

## üßæ Key Outcomes

- A professional and reliable experience for all event speakers and hosts.
- Increased attendance and engagement due to consistent and timely promotion.
- A complete and promptly updated public archive of all event recordings and materials on the website and YouTube.
- A clear, documented workflow (the Event Coordinator Playbook) that can be used and improved upon by future volunteers.
