# Open Neuromorphic Event Coordinator Playbook

### **Welcome to the ONM Events Team!**

Welcome aboard! As our Event Coordinator, you are the producer and conductor of Open Neuromorphic's live content. Your work is essential for transforming great ideas and research into engaging, accessible experiences for our global community. You are the vital link between our expert speakers, our leadership team, and our audience.

This playbook is your guide to successfully planning, executing, and archiving our events. It provides the checklists, workflows, and best practices to ensure every session is a success. We encourage you to bring your organizational skills and ideas to help us refine and improve our processes.

### **Our Core Event Goals**

1.  **Flawless Execution:** Ensure every event—from tech checks to live streams—runs smoothly and professionally.
2.  **Excellent Speaker Experience:** Provide our valued speakers with clear communication, logistical support, and a welcoming platform, making them feel appreciated and eager to return.
3.  **Maximize Community Engagement:** Drive attendance, facilitate interaction during live events, and create a welcoming atmosphere for all participants.
4.  **Create Lasting Resources:** Transform live events into high-quality, archived content that serves as a permanent educational resource for the neuromorphic community.

### **Our Event Formats**

You will be coordinating our primary event types, each with a unique goal:

*   **Workshops:** Deep dives and hands-on sessions led by experts on specific tools, hardware, or research topics.
*   **Student Talks:** A platform for students and early-career researchers to present their work, gain experience, and receive community feedback.
*   **Hacking Hours:** Live, interactive coding sessions, often with guest developers, focused on exploring software and solving technical challenges.
*   **Community Town Halls:** Our regular, informal gatherings for community updates, open discussions, and initiative planning.

### **The Event Coordination Workflow: Your Master Checklist**

This is your step-by-step guide for managing an event from conception to archive.

#### **Phase 1: Pre-Event Planning & Onboarding (4-6 Weeks Out)**

*   [ ] **Initial Contact & Scheduling:**
    *   Work with the speaker and the Executive Committee to schedule a date and time that maximizes audience reach across different time zones.
*   [ ] **Formalize Participation:**
    *   Send the speaker the **[Event Participant Agreement](https://github.com/open-neuromorphic/communications/blob/main/docs/policies/event_participant_agreement.md)** form. This is a crucial step for clarifying content licensing and sponsorship opt-in.
    *   Confirm receipt and answer any questions they may have about the policy.
*   [ ] **Create the Website Event Page:**
    *   Use the appropriate Hugo archetype to create a new event page on the [ONM website repository](https://github.com/open-neuromorphic/open-neuromorphic.github.io). (Reference: `CONTRIBUTING.md`).
    *   Collect all necessary information from the speaker:
        *   Final Title & Abstract/Description
        *   Speaker Bio & Photo (create a new contributor profile if one doesn't exist, as per Issue #341).
        *   Links to slides, code repositories, or papers.
        *   A high-quality banner image (1200x630px).
*   [ ] **Update the ONM Calendar:**
    *   Add the event to the shared Google Calendar (see Issue #77) with all relevant details and links. This will eventually power the website's "Add to Calendar" feature (Issue #331).

#### **Phase 2: Pre-Event Logistics & Promotion (1-2 Weeks Out)**

*   [ ] **Set Up the Broadcast:**
    *   Create the event in **StreamYard**.
    *   Configure the destinations (YouTube, LinkedIn) to automatically schedule the upcoming stream placeholders.
*   [ ] **Coordinate Initial Promotion:**
    *   Notify the **Social Media Coordinator** that the event page is live.
    *   Work with them to schedule the **"1 Week Before"** announcement post across all platforms.
*   [ ] **Schedule a Tech Check:**
    *   Arrange a brief (15-minute) tech check with the speaker to ensure they are comfortable with StreamYard, test their camera/mic, and walk through the screen-sharing process.

#### **Phase 3: Final Countdown (Week of Event)**

*   [ ] **Send Speaker Reminders:**
    *   A few days before the event, send a reminder email to the speaker with the final schedule, the StreamYard guest link, and contact info for day-of support.
*   [ ] **Coordinate Final Promotion:**
    *   Work with the Social Media Coordinator to execute the **"24 Hours Before"** and **"1 Hour Before"** reminder posts.
*   [ ] **Prepare the Discord Announcement:**
    *   Schedule an `@everyone` announcement in the Discord server's `#announcements` channel to go live shortly before the event starts.

#### **Phase 4: During the Event (Showtime!)**

*   [ ] **Act as Backstage Manager:**
    *   Join the StreamYard studio 15-20 minutes early to greet the speaker and host.
    *   Ensure all presenters are in the "green room" and ready to go.
    *   Manage scene transitions, on-screen comments, and banners.
*   [ ] **Monitor Stream Health:**
    *   Keep an eye on the stream quality and audience comments across platforms for any technical issues.
    *   Be the primary point of contact for troubleshooting.

#### **Phase 5: Post-Event Wrap-Up (Within 24 Hours)**

*   [ ] **Thank the Speaker:**
    *   Send a thank-you email to the speaker, including a link to the final recording.
*   [ ] **Archive the Content:**
    *   **YouTube:** Ensure the final video is titled correctly, has a full description (with links to resources), and is added to the correct playlist (e.g., "Workshops," "Student Talks").
    *   **Website:** Update the event page by adding the YouTube video ID and links to any final slides or code shared by the speaker.
*   [ ] **Coordinate Final Promotion:**
    *   Notify the Social Media Coordinator that the recording is available and trigger the **"Recording is Live"** post.
