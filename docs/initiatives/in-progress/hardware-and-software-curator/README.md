# Initiative Plan: Hardware & Software Guide Curation

**Accountable Fellow:** Hardware & Software Guide Curator (Volunteer Role)
**Approver:** @DRosen766, @Jegp, @neural-loop
**Status:** IN PROGRESS

## üéØ Objective

To strategically curate, maintain, and expand Open Neuromorphic's Hardware and Software Guides, ensuring they are the most accurate, comprehensive, and trusted resources for the neuromorphic community. This initiative aims to solidify ONM's authority, drive community growth, and create a structured knowledge base that lowers the barrier to entry for newcomers and experts alike.

## üß† Problem Statement

The current neuromorphic landscape is complex and fragmented, making it difficult for community members to navigate. Our guides are a primary entry point to ONM, but they require continuous expert attention to remain accurate and grow in strategic value beyond simple lists.

**Hypothesis:** _We believe that by actively curating our guides and developing a rich taxonomy for them, we will result in **increased website traffic, higher community engagement, and the establishment of ONM as the primary authoritative resource for the neuromorphic ecosystem.** We‚Äôll know we‚Äôve succeeded if **we see measurable growth in new members joining via the guides, increased SEO ranking for key hardware/software terms, and the successful launch of new, taxonomy-driven content hubs.**_

## üßæ Key Outcomes

-   An always-accurate and up-to-date set of hardware and software guides.
-   A clear, documented workflow for the curator role (the Curator Playbook).
-   A well-defined taxonomy for categorizing neuromorphic technologies by application, industry, and architecture.
-   The successful launch of at least one new, taxonomy-driven content hub (e.g., "Neuromorphics in Robotics").
-   Increased community contributions to the guides through a streamlined issue and PR process.

## üó∫Ô∏è Scope

| Category         | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| :--------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Must Have**    | - Regular review and updating of existing entries in the hardware and software guides. <br/> - Adding new, community-requested or newly discovered technologies. <br/> - Developing a foundational taxonomy for hardware and software based on field and industry categories. |
| **Nice to Have** | - Collaborating directly with project maintainers for content verification and accuracy. <br/> - Proposing and helping to build out new, industry-specific content hubs based on the taxonomy. <br/> - Automating parts of the content discovery process.                     |
| **Not in Scope** | - This is a **content curation and domain expertise** role, not a software development position. The curator is not responsible for building new website features or fixing site bugs. <br/> - Creating primary research; the role is to report on and structure existing knowledge. |
