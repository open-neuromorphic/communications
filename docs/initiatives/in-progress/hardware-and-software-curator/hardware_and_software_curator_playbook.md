#### **Key Areas of Focus: What You'll Curate**

Your work will revolve around three main pillars, ensuring our resources are not just lists, but structured, insightful guides.

1.  **Hardware Curation:**
    *   Maintaining and adding to the **[Neuromorphic Hardware Guide](https://open-neuromorphic.org/neuromorphic-computing/hardware/)**.
    *   Tracking new chip releases, research prototypes, and significant updates to existing platforms.
    *   Ensuring specifications, research papers, and availability statuses are accurate.

2.  **Software Curation:**
    *   Maintaining and adding to the **[Neuromorphic Software Guide](https://open-neuromorphic.org/neuromorphic-computing/software/)**.
    *   Covering the ecosystem of SNN frameworks, data processing tools, and interoperability standards (like NIR).
    *   Keeping track of new library releases, version changes, and key feature updates.

3.  **Taxonomy & Structure (The Strategic Vision):**
    *   This is the long-term goal of evolving our guides from simple lists into a structured knowledge base.
    *   **For Hardware:** Developing categories like "Edge vs. Data Center," "Digital vs. Mixed-Signal," "Research vs. Commercial."
    *   **For Software:** Refining categories like "SNN Frameworks," "Data Tools," "Interoperability."
    *   **For Both:** Brainstorming application-focused taxonomies (e.g., "Medical," "Robotics," "Aerospace") to pave the way for future industry-specific resource hubs.

#### **The Curation Playbook: Your Task List**

This is your core to-do list, broken down by type and frequency.

##### **A. Recurring Tasks (The Curation Cycle)**

*   **[Monthly] Ecosystem Scan:**
    *   **Action:** Act as a "technical reporter" for the field. Scan arXiv, key GitHub repositories, and community news for new hardware, software, or major updates.
    *   **Goal:** Identify potential new entries or necessary updates for the guides.

*   **[Bi-Weekly] Review the Issue Queue:**
    *   **Action:** Check the **[Hardware & Software Curation](https://github.com/open-neuromorphic/open-neuromorphic.github.io/issues?q=is%3Aissue+state%3Aopen+label%3A%22Hardware+%26+Software+Curation%22)** label on our website's GitHub issue tracker.
    *   **Goal:** Triage new requests from the community and plan their implementation. This is your primary source for community-driven updates.

##### **B. As-Needed Tasks (Contribution Workflow)**

*   **Onboard New Hardware/Software Entries:**
    *   **Action:** When a new technology is identified (e.g., from your scan or an issue), create a new, well-researched entry for it.
    *   **Workflow:** Follow the **Contribution Workflow** outlined below (either submit a PR or create a detailed issue).

*   **Update Existing Entries:**
    *   **Action:** When you find outdated information (e.g., a new version, a project becomes inactive), update the relevant page.
    *   **Example:** A project on our list releases a major new version. You would update its front matter and overview to reflect the changes.

*   **Collaborate with Maintainers:**
    *   **Action:** When adding a significant project (like `ngc-learn` or `NeuroTorch`), it's great practice to reach out to the maintainers. You can ask them to review your draft to ensure accuracy.
    *   **Goal:** This builds relationships and ensures our content is community-vetted and trustworthy.

##### **C. Strategic Tasks (The Long Game)**

*   **Develop Taxonomies for Industry & Research Hubs:**
    *   **Action:** This is a high-impact strategic task to architect the future of our content. Your role as a domain expert is to lead the analytical work required to structure our hardware and software guides by application area, creating the foundation for new, SEO-optimized landing pages. This is the "beachhead" that will inform our future content strategy and educational efforts.
    *   **Workflow:**
        1.  **Define the Taxonomy:** Brainstorm and define a clear set of terms for key "fields of study" (e.g., *Computational Neuroscience*, *Robotics*, *Signal Processing*) and "industry verticals" (e.g., *Medical Devices*, *Aerospace*, *Automotive*).
        2.  **Map the Ecosystem:** Create a master list or spreadsheet. For each hardware and software project on our site, you will map it to the relevant taxonomy terms you've defined. This creates the structured data we need.
        3.  **Collaborate on "Beachhead" Pages:** Work with the Executive Committee to use this new data to launch the first of these new landing pages (e.g., a `/neuromorphic-in-robotics/` page). This page would dynamically feature all the hardware, software, and content you've tagged with "Robotics," instantly creating a valuable resource for a new audience.
