## 🎯 Objective

To provide a platform for early/late-stage neuromorphic student researchers to:
    * present their (published) work, thereby sharing their research and improving visibility
    * conduct a highly engaging, knowledge sharing, honest, and critical discussion around a topic

## 🧠 Problem Statement

What problem is this initiative trying to solve?
How to help early/late-stage neuromorphic researchers to network, share, and learn from the wider ONM community?

Include a hypothesis: _“We believe X will result in Y, and we’ll know we’ve succeeded if Z.”_
We believe, holding Student Talks will help accelerating neuromorphic research, and we'll know we've succeeded if attendance and frequency of Student Talks increase over time!

## 🧾 Key Outcomes

- Far and wider reach of ONM (especially in neuromorphic student community)
- Students would be able to disseminate their research, gain feedback, and network
- In general, accelerate neuromorphic research, through discussions and knowledge sharing!

## 🗺️ Scope

We will cover student talks on topics ranging from low-level neuromorphic hardware design to high-level neuromorphic software/algorithm design.
Please take a look at our [Goals & Operations doc](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tFD7xWwX1cGx7gnNps7mUdGwN15Q6_BB/view) for more details.
The duration of student talks will be 1h 15mins, where a chunk of it will be used to deliver the talk, followed by discussion for the remaining time; refer the categories below:


| Category         | Description                                               |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| 45-50 mins talk  | Regular student talk + QnA session                        |
| 20 mins intro    | Introduction to a topic + Rich discussion/debate          |
