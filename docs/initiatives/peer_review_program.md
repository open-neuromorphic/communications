## 🎯 Objective

Establish a formal peer review program to leverage community expertise and promote high-quality open-source neuromorphic projects, offering authors valuable feedback and an ONM "stamp of approval."

---

## 🧠 Problem Statement

Open-source neuromorphic projects currently lack a standardized, community-driven process for feedback and quality assurance.  
_Hypothesis:_ We believe that a structured peer review process will increase the visibility, credibility, and reliability of neuromorphic projects, and we’ll know we’ve succeeded if participation grows and projects proudly display the “ONM Community Approved” badge.

## 🧾 Key Outcomes

- Launch of the ONM Community Peer Review Program with clear public criteria
- At least one project successfully reviewed and awarded the ONM badge
- Publication of review summaries on the ONM blog
