## 🎯 Objective

Create an official GitHub organization for Open Neuromorphic to centralize project repositories, streamline collaboration, and strengthen the group's online presence.

---

## 🧠 Problem Statement

ONM’s project repositories and collaborative resources are fragmented or lack a unified identity.
_Hypothesis:_ We believe centralizing resources in a dedicated GitHub organization will improve discoverability and governance, and we’ll know we’ve succeeded if contributors and users consistently use the organization as the hub for ONM activities.

## 🧾 Key Outcomes

- Creation of the ONM GitHub organization
- Migration and centralization of core project repositories
- Establishment of clear governance and access policies
