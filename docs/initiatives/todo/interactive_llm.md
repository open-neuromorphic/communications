‚úÖ Initiative Title: ONM Assistant ‚Äì Unified Ecosystem Chatbot

‚∏ª

üß† Vision Statement

To empower the ONM community with a conversational AI assistant that acts as a natural interface to all ONM platforms, enabling members to retrieve information, contribute to initiatives, and engage more meaningfully‚Äîregardless of their technical background or preferred channel.

‚∏ª

üîç Problem / Opportunity

ONM‚Äôs growing ecosystem‚Äîincluding Discord, LinkedIn, GitHub, and the ONM website‚Äîis rich with resources, but the fragmentation of content across platforms creates barriers to engagement and discovery. Many community members are unaware of ongoing initiatives, cannot easily locate materials, or lack the time to keep up. There‚Äôs an opportunity to unify ONM‚Äôs presence with a single point of access.

‚∏ª

üéØ Goals and Objectives
	‚Ä¢	Build a modular chatbot capable of:
	‚Ä¢	Reading and summarizing Discord discussions
	‚Ä¢	Pulling posts and analytics from ONM‚Äôs LinkedIn
	‚Ä¢	Querying and retrieving content from the ONM website and GitHub
	‚Ä¢	Responding to common questions and offering initiative guidance
	‚Ä¢	Integrate the bot within Discord and optionally as a web widget
	‚Ä¢	Enable admin workflows for initiative updates, announcements, and metrics
	‚Ä¢	Support new user onboarding with context-aware assistance
	‚Ä¢	Pilot use with the executive team, then roll out community-wide
