## 🎯 Objective

Establish standardized, repeatable methods for executing tasks across ONM, improving consistency, visibility, and operational efficiency.

---

## 🧠 Problem Statement

As ONM initiatives scale, inconsistent approaches to task management lead to duplication, dropped responsibilities, and lack of clarity.  
By creating reusable workflows and documentation standards, we can help contributors complete tasks more confidently and improve the organization’s overall reliability.

---

## 🧾 Key Outcomes

- Curated list of common ONM task types (e.g., event setup, initiative launch)  
- Standard operating procedures (SOPs) and checklist templates  
- Public documentation of repeatable workflows  
- GitHub-based tracking and labeling standards
