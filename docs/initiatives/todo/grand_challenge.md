## 🎯 Objective

Propose and plan the first ONM Grand Challenge to foster innovation, collaboration, and visibility in the neuromorphic community, providing a unifying initiative for contributors and stakeholders.

## 🧠 Problem Statement

The neuromorphic community would benefit from a high-profile, open challenge to catalyze engagement and push the field forward.
_Hypothesis:_ We believe that launching a well-structured Grand Challenge will increase community participation and innovation, and we’ll know we’ve succeeded if we see broad involvement, quality submissions, and positive external attention.
