## 🎯 Objective

Present ONM's strategic direction to the broader community to align, inspire, and activate members toward shared goals.

---

## 🧠 Problem Statement

While ONM’s leadership has developed a clear strategy, many community members are unaware of the direction or how they can contribute.  
We believe that a structured and well-communicated strategy rollout will increase transparency, drive engagement, and lead to stronger initiative participation.

---

## 🧾 Key Outcomes

- Community-wide awareness of ONM’s 2025 strategy  
- Feedback from contributors across roles and levels  
- Increased volunteer sign-ups for working groups and initiatives  
- Boost in GitHub and Discord engagement following rollout
