# **Open Neuromorphic (ONM) Organisational Charter**

## Preamble

Open Neuromorphic (ONM) is a global, open-source community fostering collaboration, knowledge sharing, and innovation in neuromorphic computing. Our mission is to build a thriving network of contributors by organizing talks, discussions, and hackathons that advance the state of the art.

## Purpose

ONM exists to:

* Promote learning and experimentation in neuromorphic computing.

* Support collaborative open-source development.

* Serve as a bridge between academia, industry, and independent contributors.

* Facilitate grassroots involvement across technical and non-technical roles.

## Governance Structure

ONM is led by a **Core Leadership Team** composed of three officers:

* **Chair**: Leads ONM, represents it externally, coordinates activities, and sets the agenda for the General Meetings (GM).

* **Vice-Chair**: Supports the Chair in strategic planning, steps in when the Chair is unavailable, and contributes to the community’s technical direction.

* **Secretary**: Maintains records, documents meetings, manages internal communication, and facilitates elections and administrative processes.

Each officer serves a **1-year term**, with new elections taking place at the conclusion of each term. Officers may be re-elected.

## Membership

Membership in Open Neuromorphic (ONM) is open to all individuals who support its mission and values.

#### **Membership Admission**

Prospective members must be **nominated by an existing member** or may **self-nominate** by submitting a brief expression of interest. The Secretary coordinates an **informal vote via email** among active members where a **majority vote determines who is invited as members**. The Secretary is responsible for collecting nominations, facilitating the email vote, and presenting the list of prospective members at the GM.

#### **Active Membership Requirements**

To remain in good standing, members must:

* Attend at least one GM within a 2-year period; or

* Submit a written contribution to the Annual Report at least once every 2 years (e.g., project updates, event summaries, reflections, proposals).

Members who fail to meet either requirement are placed on **probation**. If no activity is recorded within a **3-year period**, the member is considered **inactive** and removed from the membership roll. The Secretary notifies probationary members in their final year of inactivity.

The Secretary maintains and publishes the official membership roll, including attendance and participation records.

## Decision-Making Process

#### **Operational Decisions**

Handled by the Chair, in consultation with the Vice-Chair and Secretary.

#### **Strategic Decisions**

Decisions involving structure, major partnerships, or long-term initiatives require **majority approval** of the Core Leadership Team.

#### **General voting Rules**

* **Meeting quorum**: 1/3 of active members present.

* **Online ballots**: Valid with ≥50% participation.

* **Approval threshold**: Simple majority of valid votes cast, unless otherwise specified.

## Elections and Terms

Elections to the core leadership team occur **every year**, typically at a GM or via an online voting process. Members may nominate themselves or others. All active members are eligible to vote, and results are determined by simple majority.

Each elected officer begins a new one-year term upon confirmation. There are no term limits, but re-election is required.

If a majority of the Core Leadership Team believes that an officer is no longer actively participating in ONM, they may initiate a re-evaluation process. This entails calling for a new election for that officer’s role, which will be conducted using the standard nomination and voting procedures.

## General Meeting (GM)

A GM is held at least once per year and includes:

* Reports from the Chair and Secretary.

* Community updates and planning.

* Proposals for strategic decisions or charter amendments.

* Elections for leadership roles (when terms expire).

The meeting is open to all members and may be held virtually or in-person. Feedback is gathered in advance to ensure broad participation.

## Amendments to the Charter

Any member may propose a charter amendment by notifying one of the three officers at least one month prior to a GM.

#### **Approval**

* **At GM**: Requires quorum and 2/3 majority vote.

* **Online Ballot**: Requires ≥50% member participation and 2/3 majority to pass.

Approved amendments take effect the day after ratification.

## Code of Conduct

ONM maintains a Code of Conduct that outlines expectations for respectful participation:
