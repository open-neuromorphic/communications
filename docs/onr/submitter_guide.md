# ONM Research Initiative â€” Submitter's Guide

Welcome to the ONM Research Initiative! This guide outlines how to submit your work for review and inclusion in the ONM Community Peer Review Program.

#### Submissions are accepted on a rolling basis

---

## What Can You Submit?

We welcome open-source neuromorphic projects of all kinds, including but not limited to:

- Research codebases (e.g., SNN models, simulators, benchmarks)
- Datasets and dataset preparation pipelines
- Educational tools, tutorials, and documentation
- Hardware support libraries and FPGA/ASIC interfaces
- Analysis tools, visualization, and measurement utilities

Submissions may take the form of:
- **Git repositories** containing software and documentation  
- **Jupyter notebooks** with code, figures, and narrative explanations  
- **IEEE-formatted papers** (PDF)  
- **Technical whitepapers** or overview documents (PDF or web-hosted)  

Your project must satisfy Open Neuromorphics [Definition of Open](../policies/open-definition.md)

We especially encourage well-documented Jupyter notebooks that walk through core functionality, demonstrate reproducibility, or explain concepts interactively.  Also, please try to submit source files of figures if possible.

## How to Submit

### Prerequisites

**All authors must have existing OpenReview profiles** before submitting. If you don't have one:
1. Create an account at [OpenReview.net](https://openreview.net/)
2. Complete your profile with your name, email, and affiliations
3. Ensure your profile ID follows the format `~FirstName_LastName#` (e.g., `~Jane_Doe1`)

### Submission Process

Submit your work through OpenReview using the official ONM Research submission form.  
ðŸ”— [OpenReview ONR Submission Portal](https://openreview.net/)

You will be required to provide the following information:

#### Submission Details

1. **Title** *(required)*  
  - Max length: 250 characters  
  - Supports TeX formulas (e.g., `$â€¦$` for inline, `$$â€¦$$` for display math)  

2. **Abstract** *(required)*  
  - Max length: 5000 characters  
  - Clearly summarize your contribution, methods, and findings  

3. **Authors** *(required)*  
  - Comma-separated list (e.g., `Jane Doe, John Smith`)  

4. **Author IDs** *(required)*  
  - Comma-separated OpenReview profile IDs (e.g., `~Jane_Doe1`)  

5. **PDF** *(required)*  
  - Upload a `.pdf` file (max size: 50 MB)  
  - Include title, authors, abstract, and references  

6. **Submission Length** *(required)*  
  - Choose: `Regular submission (â‰¤8 pages)` or `Long submission (>8 pages)`  

7. **Supplementary Material** *(optional)*  
  - Upload `.zip` or `.pdf` (max size: 100 MB)  
  - May include code, datasets, figures, or videos  

8. **Previous Submission URL** *(optional)*  
  - Provide the OpenReview URL if revising a prior submission  

9. **Changes Since Last Submission** *(optional)*  
  - Describe updates made since the previous submission  

10. **Competing Interests** *(required)*  
   - Disclose conflicts of interest or enter `N/A`  

11. **Human Subjects Reporting** *(required)*  
   - Provide details if applicable, or enter `N/A`  

### After Submission

Your submission will be reviewed by a panel of 3â€“5 ONM volunteer reviewers. You'll receive confirmation and an estimated timeline for decisions.

**Note:** Submissions that do not meet the basic requirements (e.g., scope, clarity, or compliance with the [Definition of Open](../policies/open-definition.md)) may be desk rejected without further review.

## Review Criteria

Projects are evaluated based on:
- **Openness**: Is the project license-compatible and open to contributions?
- **Impact & Utility**: Does the project address significant challenges in the field of Neuromorphic Computing?
- **Clarity**: Is the project well-implemented, well-documented, and easy to navigate?
- **Documentation**: Are setup and usage instructions complete and usable?
- **Reproducibility**: Can reviewers run or verify the work easily?
- **Technical Quality**: Is the work rigorous, correct, and useful to others?

---

## Outcomes

We expect to provide decisions by a month after submission.

After review:
- If **approved**, your project will receive:
  - **For software projects:** An "ONM Community Approved" badge (for your README)
  - **For papers:** A listing in the ONM Research Registry
  - Potential to lead talks and workshops through ONM's website, Discord, and social media

- If **not yet approved**, you'll receive actionable feedback and may revise and resubmit.
