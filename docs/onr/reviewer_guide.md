# Open Neuromorphic Research Reviewer's Guide
This document can be used as a reference for reviewers when considering submissions.


## 1. Reviewer Responsibilities

As a reviewer for ONR, you're pivotal in ensuring the scientific integrity, transparency, and community value of submitted work. Your key responsibilities include:

- **Maintain professionalism and integrity.** Uphold ethical standards by disclosing potential conflicts of interest.

- **Engage constructively.** Frame your review as a collaborative, improvement-focused dialogue.

- **Ensure transparency and reproducibility.** Evaluate whether all relevant code, data, parameters, and documentation are accessible and sufficient for replication.

- **Adhere to OpenReview conventions.** This includes using correct "reader" settings for confidential or public comments, composing within the OpenReview review form, and understanding how reviews can be edited or revised.

## 2. Workflow on OpenReview

###  Profile Setup
1. **Update your OpenReview profile.** Ensure your name, email, affiliations, and research expertise fields are accurate. This aids matching your expertise to submissions.

###  Reviewer Assignment
2. **Receive assignment notification.** You’ll see assigned papers in your OpenReview “Reviewer Console” or Task list. If you have a conflict or lack expertise, contact your Area Chair promptly.

###  Writing Your Review
4. **Submit your review.** Use the structured review form within OpenReview. You can include formatted text, mathematical notation, or equations.

## 3. Guidelines for Constructive Feedback

When preparing your review, structure it thoughtfully:

1. **Start with a concise summary** of the submission’s goals and major contributions.

2. **Highlight strengths**—especially aspects like clarity, novelty, implementation, or open-science contributions.

3. **Detail major issues**—focus on elements impacting reproducibility, methodology soundness, or clarity.

4. **Offer actionable suggestions**—e.g., “Provide parameter settings used in simulations,” or “Deposit code in a version-controlled repository with DOI.”

5. **Maintain clarity and tone**—be specific, respectful, and constructive throughout.  

6. **Wrap up with a clear recommendation**, such as Accept or Revision.

7. **Use confidential comments to ACs if needed**, for sensitive observations not appropriate for authors.\

## 4. Review Criteria
### Core Principles:
Reviewers should be guided by the principles outlined in [this document](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4304228)

**Principle 1**: I will sign my name to my review

**Principle 2**: I will review with integrity

**Principle 3**: I will treat the review as a discourse with you; in particular, I will provide constructive criticism

**Principle 4**: I will be an ambassador for the practice of open science


### Evaluation Rubric

| **Category** | **Criteria** | **Reviewer Questions** |
|--------------|-------------|---------------------|
| **1. Relevance to Neuromorphic Computing** | Submission addresses a topic within the scope of neuromorphic hardware, software, methods, applications, or community building. | Does this fit within the ONR mission and topic areas? |
| **2. Clarity and Presentation** | Submission is well-organized, readable, and logically structured. Includes proper formatting and clear objectives. | Is the purpose of the work understandable? Are visuals and code outputs helpful and well-explained? |
| **3. Reproducibility** | Methods, code, and data (if applicable) are provided and clearly documented so others can replicate the work. | Could another researcher replicate the results using the materials provided? |
| **4. Technical Rigor** | The approach is appropriate and technically sound. Assumptions, parameters, and methods are well-supported. | Does the submission reflect good scientific/engineering practices? |
| **5. Contribution Type & Depth** | Clearly identifies whether this is a tool, method, experiment, or insight. Demonstrates non-trivial or novel contribution. | Is the contribution clearly articulated and meaningful in depth and originality? |
| **6. Openness and Accessibility** | Submission is open-access and includes permissive licensing for reuse (e.g., MIT, Apache, CC-BY). Uses open tools/formats. | Are all code, data, and documents accessible and reusable? |
| **7. Format Compliance** | Adheres to ONR submission guidelines (length, file types, structure, metadata, licensing, etc.) | Are filenames, licenses, and structure in line with guidance? |
| **8. Community Value** | Has potential to be reused, extended, or learned from by others in the neuromorphic community. | Would this benefit students, researchers, or developers in ONM? |
