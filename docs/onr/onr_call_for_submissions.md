# Call for Submissions — Open Neuromorphic Research Initiative (ONR)

ONM invites you to contribute your work to the Open Neuromorphic Research (ONR) program. Whether you're developing tools, conducting experiments, writing tutorials, or sharing insights — we want your contributions.

Submissions are lightweight, open-source, and evaluated collaboratively<!-- via [OpenReview](https://openreview.net/group?id=openneuromorphic.org/ONR)-->.

## What Can You Submit?

We welcome:
- Jupyter Notebooks (preferred): demos, tutorials, experiments
- Short Papers: IEEE-style PDFs (2–6 pages)
- Whitepapers: design docs, proposals, or conceptual work

Your submission should:
- Be openly licensed (MIT, Apache, CC-BY, etc.)
- Include code, data, or other supporting materials
- Follow the [ONR Submission Guide](https://github.com/open-neuromorphic/communications/blob/main/docs/onr/submitter_guide.md)

## Example Submissions

- Benchmarking neuromorphic simulators  
- Implementing a novel SNN architecture  
- Sharing a reproducible sensor pipeline  
- Proposing a collaborative hardware standard  
- Writing a beginner-friendly tutorial on event-based vision
