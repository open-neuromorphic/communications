## Part 2: Content from Community Participants and Contributors

This section applies to anyone who contributes content to the ONM community, including event speakers, workshop participants, and project collaborators.

### Guiding Principle

To maintain our open-source mission, we require that contributions made through ONM platforms are licensed in a way that allows for public sharing and reuse. By participating, you grant ONM a non-exclusive, perpetual license to record, reproduce, and distribute your contribution under the terms outlined below.

### Licensing Requirements for Contributions

1.  **Compliance with ONM's Open Definition:** By presenting, speaking, or sharing content, you affirm that your contribution complies with **ONM's Principles for Open Resources**. Your work must, at a minimum, allow for study, modification, sharing, and commercial use.

    > For full details, please review our **[Definition of Open](../policies/open-definition.md)**.

2.  **Default Licensing:** To ensure legal clarity, if you do not specify a license for your work at the time of contribution, you agree that ONM will share it under our default licenses:
    -   **Presentation Materials (slides, video, audio):** Released under **CC-BY-SA 4.0**.
    -   **Code Snippets and Demonstrations:** Released under the **MIT License**.

3.  **Using Your Own License:** We encourage you to use your own preferred open-source license. If your materials are already licensed under a different license (e.g., Apache 2.0, CC-BY), please **inform us in advance** or make the license clear in your materials. As long as it complies with our Definition of Open, we will honor it and make a note of the specific license when sharing your work.

### Policy for Event Attendance

For all ONM-hosted events (e.g., Student Talks, workshops, hacking hours):

-   **Consent to Record:** Events will be recorded and made publicly available. Your attendance and active participation serve as consent to be recorded and for your contributions to be shared under the terms described above.
-   **Consent Regarding Sponsorship:** Some ONM events or programs may be supported by sponsors. All speakers and key participants will be notified in advance if an event is sponsored. Participation in a sponsored event is strictly **opt-in**. We are committed to providing a space for all community members, and further details can be found in our **[Sponsorship Policy](./sponsorship_policy.md)**.

### How We Communicate This Policy

This policy will be clearly communicated to participants via:
-   Speaker agreement emails.
-   Event registration pages.

If you have any questions or concerns about this policy, please contact the ONM leadership team before contributing.
