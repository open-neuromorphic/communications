### **ONM's Principles for Open Resources**
To be considered a fully open resource in our community, a work **MUST**:
-   **Allow anyone to study, modify, and share** the material for any purpose, including commercial use.
-   **Provide materials in a publicly accessible format that allows for modification and reuse.** For text or code, this means source files (e.g., Markdown, notebooks). For other media, the published format is often the source (e.g., a CC-licensed PDF or YouTube video).
-   **Not restrict derivatives.**
-   **Not be released under a "Non-Commercial" (NC) license.**

A resource **MAY**:
-   **Require attribution** be given to the original creators (like CC-BY).
-   **Require derivatives to carry a reciprocal license** (like Share-Alike "SA" or GPL).

We will prioritize resources with permissive licenses like **CC-BY**, **CC-BY-SA**, **MIT**, and **Apache 2.0**. While we still value resources with Non-Commercial (NC) or No-Derivatives (ND) clauses, we will mark them as having restrictions, as they do not grant the full freedom to the community to build upon them.

###  Licensing Note:
This policy and associated ONM website content are released under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike (CC BY-SA) license. The ShareAlike clause ensures that any derivatives or adaptations remain equally open and freely available, reinforcing our commitment to openness and community benefit. We recognize that ShareAlike may limit adoption by organizations that wish to apply additional restrictions, but we believe this approach best protects the open, collaborative spirit of our community.
