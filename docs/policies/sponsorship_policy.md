# Open Neuromorphic (ONM) Sponsorship Policy v1.0

## 1. Preamble & Sponsorship Philosophy

Open Neuromorphic (ONM) is a community-first organization dedicated to fostering a globally inclusive, open, and sustainable ecosystem for neuromorphic computing. We welcome partnerships with organizations, academic institutions, and companies that share our commitment to this mission.

Sponsorship is a vital component of our sustainability, enabling us to maintain our digital infrastructure, support community initiatives, and create high-quality educational content. This policy outlines the principles and procedures that govern our relationships with all sponsors to ensure our partnerships are transparent, mutually beneficial, and always aligned with our core community values.

**Licensing Note:**  
This policy and associated ONM website content are released under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike (CC BY-SA) license. The ShareAlike clause ensures that any derivatives or adaptations remain equally open and freely available, reinforcing our commitment to openness and community benefit. We strongly discourage the application of more restrictive licenses (such as NonCommercial or NoDerivatives clauses) to remixed or derivative works, as this can create a “remixing dead end” and limit the ongoing collaborative evolution of these resources. Our intent is for ONM resources to remain living works—always available for adaptation, reuse, and further remixing by the community.

## 2. Guiding Principles

All sponsorship activities and agreements shall be governed by the following core principles:

-   **2.1. Community First:** The interests, integrity, and neutrality of the Open Neuromorphic community are paramount. No sponsorship agreement shall compromise the community's trust or the organization's ability to act in the community's best interest.
-   **2.2. Editorial Independence:** ONM retains full and independent control over all content, event programming, and strategic direction. Sponsors shall have no editorial influence, approval rights, or veto power over our content or activities.
-   **2.3. Transparency:** All sponsorship relationships will be publicly disclosed on our Supporters page. The terms of recognition for each sponsorship level are defined in this policy and will be applied consistently.
-   **2.4. Value Alignment:** We will seek partnerships with organizations whose values and goals are aligned with the principles of open science, collaboration, and ethical technology development.

> **Interpretation of Community Interest:**  
> The “community’s interest” is interpreted and upheld by the ONM Executive Committee, in alignment with the organization’s charter and in consultation with stakeholders and community members. Decisions impacting the community are made transparently, in accordance with documented standards and policies, and with opportunities for community feedback and discussion.

## 3. Sponsorship Tiers & Recognition

**Clarification of General vs. Program Sponsorship:**  
Supporter tiers (Foundational, Gold, Platinum) recognize organizations or individuals who contribute to ONM’s general fund, which supports the overall mission and ongoing operations.

> Program sponsorships are separate and allow organizations to support specific ONM initiatives or events (e.g., “Hacking Hours”), with recognition tied to that program.  
> It is possible for a sponsor to be both a general supporter (e.g., Gold Supporter) and a program sponsor. In such cases, their contributions and recognition will be acknowledged in both relevant sections.

ONM offers several tiers of support. All financial contributions are considered donations to support the general mission and operations of ONM, with recognition provided as follows:

#### 3.1. Foundational Supporters (In-Kind)
-   **Contribution:** Non-monetary support through active community partnership, such as adding the ONM Collaboration Network badge to an open-source project's primary repository or website.
-   **Recognition:**
    -   Logo and link on the "Foundational Supporters" section of the ONM Supporters page.
    -   Public acknowledgment as a member of the Collaboration Network.

#### 3.2. Gold Supporters (Financial)
-   **Contribution:** Annual financial donation within the defined Gold tier range (e.g., $1,000 - $4,999 USD).
-   **Recognition:**
    -   Logo and link on the "Gold Supporters" section of the ONM Supporters page.
    -   Mention in ONM's annual community report.

#### 3.3. Platinum Supporters (Financial)
-   **Contribution:** Annual financial donation within the defined Platinum tier range (e.g., $5,000+ USD).
-   **Recognition:**
    -   Prominent logo placement and link on the "Platinum Supporters" section of the ONM Supporters page.
    -   Prominent mention in ONM's annual community report.
    -   One-time acknowledgment in a social media post announcing the partnership, issued annually or at a regular interval (such as every six months) for continuing Platinum Supporters.

> As ONM’s sponsorship programs evolve, the specific forms of recognition and acknowledgment—including social media mentions—may be updated based on ongoing feedback and engagement with sponsors. Any such changes will be communicated transparently and reflected in this policy.

## 4. Specific Program Sponsorships

Organizations may choose to sponsor specific, ongoing community programs (e.g., "Hacking Hours"). These sponsorships are distinct from the general tiers and subject to the following conditions:

-   **Sponsors may hold both a general supporter tier and a program sponsorship simultaneously.** For example, a Gold Supporter may also sponsor a specific ONM program, receiving recognition for both contributions as outlined in this policy.
-   **4.1. Branding:** Recognition will be in the format of "Program Name, brought to you by [Sponsor Name]." Branding will be limited to the program's landing page and a brief, standardized mention at the beginning of program events.
-   **4.2. Community Consent (The Opt-In Mandate):** All guest speakers, hosts, or other invited contributors in a sponsored program must be informed of the sponsorship in advance and have the right to participate on a strictly **opt-in** basis. Should any invited guest (e.g., a speaker or workshop host) express discomfort or decline to participate due to the presence of a sponsor, **ONM's standard procedure will be to omit all sponsor branding from that specific event.** This action ensures the guest can participate without conflict, reaffirming that our commitment to community members is our highest priority. **No participant will ever be required to provide a reason or justification for their decision.**
-   **Attendees:** While all attendees will be informed of program sponsorship in event materials and announcements, we do not require explicit opt-in from general attendees. However, feedback from attendees will always be welcomed and can be used to guide future sponsorship practices.

## 5. Sponsorship Approval Process

To ensure transparency and collective oversight, all sponsorship agreements must follow this procedure:

-   **5.1. Inquiry:** All sponsorship inquiries shall be directed to the official ONM contact channel (`contact@open-neuromorphic.org`).
-   **5.2. Review:** The Executive Committee will review the potential sponsor for alignment with ONM's values (Principle 2.4).
-   **5.3. Formal Agreement:** A standard Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) or Sponsorship Agreement will be drafted, explicitly referencing this policy and detailing the contribution and the defined recognition benefits. No verbal promises or ad-hoc benefits will be considered binding.
-   **5.4. Final Approval & Execution:** The final agreement **requires the documented approval and signature of at least two (2) members of the Executive Committee** (e.g., Chair and Vice-Chair) to be considered valid.

## 6. Code of Conduct for Sponsors

All sponsors are expected to respect the ONM Code of Conduct and interact with the community in a constructive and respectful manner. ONM reserves the right to terminate a sponsorship agreement at any time if a sponsor's actions are found to be in violation of our community principles.

## 7. What ONM Sponsorship Is Not

ONM sponsorship does **not** entail:

- An obligation for ONM to actively promote, endorse, or market the sponsor’s products, services, or organization beyond the recognition explicitly described in this policy.
- Editorial influence or control by sponsors over ONM’s activities, events, or content.
- Any ongoing guarantee of recognition beyond the scope and duration of the agreed sponsorship tier or program.
- Automatic renewal of sponsorship status or recognition; each sponsorship must be agreed upon and approved according to the procedures in this policy.

Sponsorships are intended to support ONM’s mission and community, not to serve as marketing or advertising platforms for sponsors.

## 8. Policy Review

This policy shall be reviewed annually by the Executive Committee to ensure it continues to serve the best interests of the Open Neuromorphic community.

**Note:**  
The sponsorship program and recognition practices are subject to periodic review and adjustment as ONM continues to develop its approach in consultation with the community and sponsors.
