### 🚀 Go Further (Optional): Create a Live Preview

For contributors comfortable with Git, you can take your contribution a step further by creating a live preview of your blog post on your own staging site. This allows you to see exactly how your content will look and is the best way to collaborate on visual and formatting details.

Our contribution guides provide a full walkthrough of the process:
- **[CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/open-neuromorphic/open-neuromorphic.github.io/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)**: For local setup and general contributions.
- **[CONTRIBUTING-Staging.MD](https://github.com/open-neuromorphic/open-neuromorphic.github.io/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING-Staging.MD)**: For setting up your own live preview environment.
