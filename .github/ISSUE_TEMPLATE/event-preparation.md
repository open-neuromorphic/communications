Preliminary Event description:


### Phase 1: Pre-Event Planning & Onboarding

- [ ] **Initial Contact & Scheduling:**

  - [ ] Confirm receipt and answer any questions they may have about the policy.
- [ ] **Collect all necessary information from the speaker:**
  - [ ] Speaker Bio & Photo
  - [ ] Links to slides, code repositories, or papers (can be published before or after)
- [ ] **Create the Website Event Page:**
  - [ ] Use the appropriate Hugo archetype to create a new event page on the ONM website repository. (Reference: `CONTRIBUTING.md`).

- [ ] **Update the ONM Calendar:**

### Phase 3: Final Countdown (Week of Event)

- [ ] **Send Speaker Reminders:**
  - [ ] A few days before the event, send a reminder email to the speaker with the final schedule, the StreamYard guest link, and contact info for day-of support.

  - [ ] Work with the Social Media Coordinator to execute the reminder posts.
- [ ] **Prepare the Discord Announcement:**

  - [ ] Join the StreamYard studio 15-20 minutes early to greet the speaker and host.
  - [ ] Ensure all presenters are in the "green room" and ready to go.
  - [ ] Manage scene transitions, on-screen comments, and banners.
- [ ] **Monitor Stream Health:**
  - [ ] Keep an eye on the stream quality and audience comments across platforms for any technical issues.
